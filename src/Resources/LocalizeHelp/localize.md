# Localize an Application

As a localizer, you want to edit a project that a developer has uploaded to Localize.  To do this, you need to be [logged in](login.html) first.  After logging in, you need to [search](search.html) for the project that you want to edit.  After locating the project in the main view of the application, you can simply double-click the application.  The project's contents will be displayed, and you can then double-click a globalization string to attempt to change the project.  If this project is yours, you will be allowed to make changes in the new window that appears.  If this project does not belong to you, you will see a pop-up asking if you wish to branch the project.  Select "Yes," and you will then have your own version of the project that you can edit and make changes to.

# Editing Globalization Strings

To Edit an actual globalization resource, you can simply select it in the main view of the application while the project is selected.  At the bottom of the screen, all the available strings to be edited will appear with their identifier and value in the target language.  By double-clicking these strings, you will open a new window that allows a localizer to edit, add, and remove information from the strings.  Once you are done, simply hit "Done," as your changes are automatically saved.
