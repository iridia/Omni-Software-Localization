<h1 id="login">Login</h1>

<p>To login to Localize, simply click the blue icon in the upper-right hand corner of the application, which is labeled &#8220;Login/Register.&#8221;  This will bring up a window that will prompt for your username and password, which you would have previously set upon <a href="register.html">registering.</a>  Upon entering your username and password, click the &#8220;Login&#8221; button on the newly created window.  If there is an error with the information you provided, you will be notified, and asked to re-enter your login information.  Otherwise, the login window will disappear and you will have access to Localize.</p>
