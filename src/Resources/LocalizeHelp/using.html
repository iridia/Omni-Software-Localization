		<h1>Using Localize</h1>
	</div>
</div>

<p>How does Localize work?  There are two major roles that you can take on using Localize, a developer and a localizer.  A developer uses Localize to bring their application to the world, and relies on localizers to translate their globalization resources to different languages.  A localizer is a language expert, such as a native speaker, that is able to translate an application in one language into another.</p>

<p>First, users must <a href="register.html">register</a>, creating their personal account and profile within Localize.  After following the simple on-screen directions, the user will <a href="login.html">login</a> to utilize the full features of Localize.</p>

<p>By <a href="uploadAnApp.html">uploading</a> their applications to Localize, a developer can reach many other parts of the world that they could not before. All the projects that are uploaded by a user will appear in the sidebar, under the &#8220;Projects&#8221; disclosure.</p>

<p>After <a href="login.html">logging in</a>, a localizer can go <a href="search.html">search</a> for a project that has been uploaded to Localize. By double-clicking on the desired project, the project&#8217;s contents will be displayed.  To edit and <a href="localize.html">localize</a> a project, you can select any resource in the project&#8217;s content, and then double-click on any single globalization string to make changes.</p>
