Many pieces and technologies work together to produce a software application. Localize is no different. This document will describe the high-level design of Localize from three angles:  the software, the system, and testing.

The software architecture and design document covers the pieces that make up the user-facing features of Localize. This includes the design of the main client application and the rationale behind this design.

The system architecture and design document details the various components of Localize from a high-level. The main features of this are the client-server interaction and the technologies used on the server.

Finally, the test architecture and design document describes the Localize team's approach to testing.
