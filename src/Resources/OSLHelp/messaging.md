# Messaging Help

Messaging is a nice way to communicate with other users of Localize. You may want to use the messaging system to:

* Communicate with friends you meet on Localize
* Ask other localizers or developers questions
* Interact with the developer of the application you are currently localizing
* Let users that are currently working on localizing your application know about updates

## Sending a basic message

To send a message, click "New Message" in the toolbar or select Community > Send Message from the menu bar. In the "Send Message" window that appears:

1. Type the email address of the user you wish to message
2. Enter a subject
3. Type your message
4. Click "Send Message"

Your message will be sent to that user and she can read it the next time she logs in to Localize.

## Broadcasting a message

Broadcast messages are an easy way to communicate with all the users that are subscribed to your project. This may be other developers, but will usually be all the localizers working on localizing your project.

To send a broadcast message to all subscribers of a project:

1. Select a project from the sidebar
2. Select Project > New Broadcast... from the menu bar
3. In the window that appears, enter a subject and a message
4. Click "Send Message"

The message will be broadcast to all your subscribers and they can read it the next time they log in to Localize.
