h1. Coding Style Guidelines

The following guidelines were decided by the team on how to best represent the code so that it would be readable, navigable, and easy to understand.  These guidelines are not simple preferences such as spacings, etc. but rather larger concepts so that other coders can understand and work with our source code.  Many of these decisions were not made at the inception of the project, but were rather decided during code dojos and code reviews as we encountered new coding decisions.

h2. Navigating A Source File

For classes, the following is the order in which things should appear:

# ivars (without an underscore. *Note: this is different from what we had previously determined. From this point forward, underscores are not preferable.*)
# class methods
# initializers (default initializer(s) should come last)
# paired getters/setters
# instance methods
# notifications
# private methods
# datasource (on a category)
# observers (on a category)
