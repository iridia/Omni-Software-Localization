<p>To register with Localize, simply click the blue icon in the upper-right hand corner of the application labeled &#8220;Login/Register.&#8221; This will bring up a window for login.  By clicking the button in the bottom-left hand corner of this new window, Localize will prompt for your user information.  Enter your desired registration information in the window, and when finished, click on the &#8220;Register&#8221; button.  The application will alert you if there was an error with your information, upon which you will need to alter the data and click on &#8220;Register&#8221; again.  If successful, the window will disappear, and you will be logged in. </p>
