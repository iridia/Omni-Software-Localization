# Using Localize

How does Localize work?  There are two major roles that you can take on using Localize, a developer and a localizer.  A developer uses Localize to bring their application to the world, and relies on localizers to translate their globalization resources to different languages.  A localizer is a language expert, such as a native speaker, that is able to translate an application in one language into another.

# Developers

First, users must [register](register.html), creating their personal account and profile within Localize.  After following the simple on-screen directions, the user will [login](login.html) to utilize the full features of Localize.

By [uploading](uploadAnApp.html) their applications to Localize, a developer can reach many other parts of the world that they could not before. All the projects that are uploaded by a user will appear in the sidebar, under the "Projects" disclosure.

# Localizers

After [logging in](login.html), a localizer can go [search](search.html) for a project that has been uploaded to Localize. By double-clicking on the desired project, the project's contents will be displayed.  To edit and [localize](localize.html) a project, you can select any resource in the project's content, and then double-click on any single globalization string to make changes.
